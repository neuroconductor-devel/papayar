Title: View Medical Research Images using the Papaya JavaScript Library
Version: 1.0
Date: 2016-09-23
Author: John Muschelli
Maintainer: John Muschelli <muschellij2@gmail.com>
Description: Users pass images and objects of class 'nifti' from the
        'oro.nifti' package to a Papaya, an interactive lightweight
        JavaScript viewer. Although many packages can view individual
        slices or projections of image and matrix data, this package
        allows for quick and easy interactive browsing of images.  The
        viewer is based off of the Mango software, which is a
        lightweight medical image viewer.
